    <h1>Understanding Parallel Structure in Sentences</h1>
    <p>A sentence is considered "out of control" if it contains a list of items that disrupts the sentenceâ€™s grammatical consistency, making it nonsensical or ungrammatical.</p>
    
    <h2>Example 1</h2>
    <div class="example">
        <p><strong>Original Sentence:</strong> Mary likes walking, swimming, and to ride a bicycle.</p>
        <p class="problem"><strong>Problem:</strong> The sentence mixes gerunds ("walking," "swimming") with an infinitive ("to ride"), leading to inconsistent verb forms.</p>
        <p class="corrected"><strong>Corrected Sentence:</strong> Mary likes walking, swimming, and riding a bicycle.</p>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> To maintain parallelism, all items in the list should use the same form. Here, using gerunds ("walking," "swimming") for consistency is appropriate.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Example 2</h2>
    <div class="example">
        <p><strong>Original Sentence:</strong> Dragons are big, green, and eat people.</p>
        <p class="problem"><strong>Problem:</strong> The sentence mixes descriptions with actions in a way that disrupts the parallel structure. It seems to say:
        <ul>
            <li>Dragons are big.</li>
            <li>Dragons are green.</li>
            <li>Dragons eat people (this disrupts the parallelism as the action "eat" is not part of the descriptive list).</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="corrected"><strong>Corrected Sentence:</strong> Dragons are big, green, and eat people.</p>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> To maintain parallelism and clarity, the corrected sentence should clearly separate descriptions from actions.</p>
