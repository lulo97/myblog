        something.
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          We usually use the auxiliary verbs <strong>"do"</strong> or
          <strong>"does"</strong> to form negative sentences, yes/no questions,
          and wh-questions in the simple present tense.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Positive:</strong> "He eats."
          <br />
          <strong>Negative:</strong> "He does not eat."
          <br />
          <strong>Yes/No question:</strong> "Does he eat?"
          <br />
          <strong>Wh-question:</strong> "What does he eat?"
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the verb <strong>"to be"</strong> forms negatives and
          questions differently, without using "do" or "does."
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Positive:</strong> "I am."
          <br />
          <strong>Negative:</strong> "I am not."
          <br />
          <strong>Yes/No question:</strong> "Am I?"
          <br />
          <strong>Wh-question:</strong> "Who am I?"
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
