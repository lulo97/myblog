    <h2>Present simple tense</h2>
      <p>
        Base form verb if subject is first/second pronouns:
        <i>I swim in river.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Add 's to verb if subject is third pronouns:
        <i>He/She/It swims in river</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Use "do" if question subject is first/second pronouns:
        <i>Do you swim there?</i>
        <i>Where do I put it?</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Use "does" if question subject is third pronouns:<i
          >Does she live there?</i
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Question with "where", "what", "when" is used with "do", "does". But
        question with who" often not. <i>Who lived there?</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Present simple is use to talk about
        <div>
          <p>Something true in present</p>
          <p>Something happens regularly in present</p>
          <p>Something always true</p>
          <p>Something that fixed in the future</p>
        </div>
      </p>
      <p>
        Adverb of frequency like "always", "sometimes", "never" often use in
        present simple
      </p>
      <p>
        If current context is future, present simple sentence often come after
        words "after", "before", "when", "if", "unless".
      </p>
      <p>
        Present simple is use to talk about past when telling story, summarising
        something.
      </p>
      <p>
        <p>
          We usually use the auxiliary verbs <strong>"do"</strong> or
          <strong>"does"</strong> to form negative sentences, yes/no questions,
          and wh-questions in the simple present tense.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Positive:</strong> "He eats."</li>
          <br />
          <li><strong>Negative:</strong> "He does not eat."</li>
          <br />
          <li><strong>Yes/No question:</strong> "Does he eat?"</li>
          <br />
          <li><strong>Wh-question:</strong> "What does he eat?"</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          However, the verb <strong>"to be"</strong> forms negatives and
          questions differently, without using "do" or "does."
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Positive:</strong> "I am."</li>
          <br />
          <li><strong>Negative:</strong> "I am not."</li>
          <br />
          <li><strong>Yes/No question:</strong> "Am I?"</li>
          <br />
          <li><strong>Wh-question:</strong> "Who am I?"</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Example: I heard from David last night. He says hello.
        <ul>
          <li>Both past simple and present simple can be use here.</li>
          <li>"He says hello" meaning that David say hello to you through me now.</li>
          <li>"He said hello" meaning that David said hello to you when I was talking to him last night.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
