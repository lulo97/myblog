Oracle Architechture consists of 3 components:
- Process (similar to main process CPU of computer)
- Memory (similar to memory RAM, ROM... of computer)
- Storage (similar to physical disk of computer)

Oracle Instance = Process + Memory
- Storage can have mutiple databases and mutiple instances
- One instance can modify only one database

Memory = System Global Area (SGA) + Program Global Area (PGA)
- SGA = Memory for mutiple session can share data 
- PGA = Memory for only paticular session can use
- A same query can take 10 second first time run and 1 second secon time run because it already store in SGA in first time

Process = User process + Server process + Background process
- User process is created when client tool (SQL Navigator) connect to server through Listener
- A listener is a process on server side, taking user process data and ship it to Server process
- Server process once establish connection with user process (client process) it will skip listener and directly communicate.
- A dedicated server is server process that connect with one client process only
- A shared server is server process that connect with mutiple client
- Background process is an independent process (not like server process and user process need each other) that handle database operations like ensure data integrity, performance, recover...
    + DBWn = Database Writer Process: Write data from memory (SGA, PGA) to physical disk 
    + CKPT = Checkpoint Process: Singnaling DBWn to write data
    + LGWR = Log Writer Process: Write log
    + ARCn = Archiver Process: Backup/Recover log file
