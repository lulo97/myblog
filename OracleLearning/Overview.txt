Oracle is enterprise-level database
Oracle designed for high-performance application
Oracle contains server-client architechture
Oracle is more complex than MySQL

Core component of Orace Database:
- Server: Place where actually data is store
    + Database: Physical disk to store data
    + Instance: A set or Oracle processes (DBWR, LGWR), memories (System Global Area) to manage database operations
    + A physical disk on server can have mutiple databases and mutiple instances
    + But one instance can only modify one database
- Client: Tools or applications like SQL*Plus, Sql Developer, Sql Navigator, Backend projects...
    + Oracle have own network protocal (SQL*Net or Oracle Net Services) to communication between server and client
    + Client tools must have to understand that network protocal
    + This design imply networking is a seperate layer. Unlike like MySQL, SQLServer the networking part is handle simplier.

Oracle Listener is a background process that listen to client request.
Oracle Listener is placed inside server.
Orcale Listener configuration by listener.ora file.

Transparent Network Substrate (TNS): A protocal to handle server-client communication.

SQL*Plus: A build-in tool by Oracle for running SQL commands and PL/SQL scripts.

SQL Developer is a graphical user interface (GUI) tool provided by Oracle for interacting with the database. (Same as SQL Server Management Studio or MySQL Workbench.)

SQL Navigator is like SQL Developer but thirt-party tool by Toad.

ORACLE_HOME = This environment variable points to the directory where Oracle is installed on your system. It is critical because it tells the system where to find Oracle binaries and configuration files.

Schemas: A schema in Oracle is essentially a user. It is a collection of database objects owned by a user, including tables, views, indexes, and stored procedures.
Example: When you log in to Oracle (e.g., system), youâ€™re working within that user's schema.
